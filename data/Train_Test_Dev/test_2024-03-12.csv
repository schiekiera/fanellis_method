"We predicted that a lower BMI, a higher frequency of physical and mental activities, a lower frequency of alcohol consumption, non-smoking, a non-vegetarian diet, and a more regular social rhythm would be predictive of better mental health at baseline, operationalized as higher PMH and fewer MHP.  nan Better mental health (higher PMH and fewer MHP) at baseline was predicted by a lower body mass index, a higher frequency of physical and mental activities, non-smoking, a non-vegetarian diet, and a more regular social rhythm.",1.0
"It was hypothesized, that the relationship between rumination and suicide ideation would be fully mediated by perceptions of entrapment. nan Consistent with our prediction, perceptions of entrapment fully mediated the association between ruminative thinking and suicide ideation – independent of depression, anxiety and stress.",1.0
"Based on theoretical assumptions and empirical findings, we expected first that chat-based communication was associated with a different perception of the counselor than face-to-face communication, Compared to face-to-face, counselors in chat-based communication were perceived as stricter and less attractive. Perceived trustworthiness of the counselor in the chat condition was more strongly associated with treatment outcome than in face-to-face. nan",1.0
"The aims of this study were to (a) replicate the negative association between the severity of psychopathology and sleep variables nan In contrast, objective sleep parameters were not related to psychopathology.",0.0
"With the present study, we aimed to test a screening instrument which allows an efficient and comparatively inexpensive investigation of such questions in representative surveys among the general population. nan The present study successfully tested an efficient and economical survey instrument for clinical and everyday-life anxieties in the general population. ",1.0
"On this background, PMH was expected to be negatively related to suicide ideation and suicide attempts (Hypothesis 1). nan In the current study, PMH was negatively related to lifetime suicide ideation and lifetime suicide attempts (confirmation of Hypothesis 1).",1.0
"Based on the previous literature we expect that an improved use of cognitive restructuring, relaxation and activity despite pain are equally related to changes in clinical outcome measures. nan According to our data, both the cognitive approach (cognitive restructuring and mental distraction) and the respondent approach (relaxation) but not the operant approach (activity despite pain) seem to be important for the treatment of chronic pain.",1.0
"The first aim was to conduct a recalibration of the ADIB through secondary analysis of data from the study of Forkmann et al. [18] using more strict criteria in order to improve unidimensionality, local independence and reduce DIF. nan Generally, item bank characteristics in the recalibration were very good, indicated by absence of DIF, evidence for strict unidimensionality and good overall and individual item fit.",1.0
"We hypothesize that (Ia) acute increases in the intensity of acceptance and reappraisal from one measurement point to the next, are predictive of lower levels of negative afect and paranoid thoughts Ia) An acute increase in acceptance and reappraisal between two measurement points t−1 and t was predictive of lower levels of negative afect at t when controlling for negative afect at t−1. An acute increase in acceptance between t − 1 and t predicted less pronounced paranoid thoughts at t when controlling for paranoid thoughts at t−1. An acute increase in reappraisal was not a signifcant predictor of paranoid thoughts. nan",1.0

"Along the theoretical grounds outlined above, we expected COLBAS to be composed of five dimensions: two problem-solving (knowledge acquisition and knowledge application) and three collaboration dimensions (questioning, requesting, and asserting).  A latent confirmatory factor analysis suggested a five-dimensional construct with two problem-solving dimensions (knowledge acquisition and knowledge application) and three collaboration dimensions (questioning, asserting, and requesting).  nan",1.0
"This study evaluated the effect of a web-based guided self-help intervention on the prevention of MDD onset in an adult population with subthreshold depression. nan Among patients with subthreshold depression, the use of a web-based guided self-help intervention compared with enhanced usual care reduced the incidence of MDD over 12 months.",1.0
"Specifically, we hypothesized to find (1) an increased conflict adaptation effect in both PTSD patients and traumatized controls as an extension of our previous findings nan The current data confirm our previous findings of more pronounced conflict adaptation in PTSD patients compared to non-trauma-exposed individuals with a medium effect size in an overlapping, larger sample (Steudte-Schmiedgen et al., 2014). This finding supports meta-analytical data of Scott et al. (2015) suggesting a medium effect size for a combined EF score. However, contrary to the hypothesis derived from our previous study (Steudte-Schmiedgen et al., 2014), the difference between healthy trauma-exposed and non-exposed individuals did not reach level of statistical significance.",1.0
"The goal of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire operationalizing the main mechanisms presumably responsible for persisting dysfunctional expectations. nan The resulting questionnaire showed an excellent internal consistency and a good to excellent consistency for the three factors. Furthermore, the suggested three-factor structure of the 23-item scale could be confirmed in a second study by a CFA, showing good-fit measures. The internal consistency remained good to excellent for the overall questionnaire and the three subscales. A very good test–retest reliability could be proven.",1.0
"Based on the existing ED literature, we hypothesized that ED patients would report higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties than HC As expected, participants in the ED group reported greater difficulties in emotion regulation across all dimensions; all effect sizes accompanying these mean differences were medium to large. nan",1.0
"We expect former SRH to be the strongest predictor of future SRH. Additionally, future SRH is also predicted by a number of variables that reflect health appraisal such as general well-being, functional health, and physical limitations (hypothesis 1). Results for all three multiple mediator analyses are presented in Table 3. To test whether comorbidity and health appraisal (emotional well-being, functional health and physical limitations) contributed to the effect of former SRH on future SRH multiple mediator models were tested. For all three subgroups, there was a significant total, direct, and indirect total effect demonstrating a partial mediation by the proposed variables (hypothesis 1). nan",1.0
"The unidimensionality of the subscales was additionally tested via item response theory or confirmatory factor analysis. nan Our investigation of the psychometric properties and factor structure of the MeKKi indicates that most of the MeKKi subscales were unidimensional with one latent dimension underlying each subscale. The only exception was Visual Emotion Identification, which showed some estimation problems that need further investigation.",1.0
"Our main hypothesis was that participating in a single-session mindfulness exercise would lead to increased levels of subjective arousal but not impact genital sexual arousal in women when compared to a visualization exercise. nan Thus, our first hypothesis was only partially supported.",1.0
"Specifically, we addressed the question of whether spatial selective attention reduces the intertrial latency jitter of LEP components nan Furthermore, single-trial analysis indicates that spatial attention also modulated the latency jitter of the LEP components (N2, P2).",1.0
"Firstly, from the results of a former study, it was inferred that low scores in the personality trait self-directedness would predispose subjects to higher scores on FA nan Our hypothesis, that self-directedness would relate to FA both on a direct and on an indirect path mediated by emotion regulation and negative urgency, was not supported by the data",0.0
"Based on previous results, we expected HSA children to evidence: (1) a sympathetically modulated hyperarousal during baseline along disturbances in sympatho-vagal balance nan Beside a higher increase in subjective anxiety from baseline to anticipation in anxious children, the HSA group showed a trend toward an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic branches at baseline, partially confirming our first hypothesis: borderline significant higher baseline levels of LF and significantly higher LF/HF ratios suggested higher cardiac sympathetic dominance in relation to parasympathetic control [25, 26, 45].",1.0
" We hypothesised that after the induction of body dissatisfaction, BED women in the rumination condition would react with an exacerbation of weight and appearance satisfaction, current mood and distress about body feelings. The 2 (condition: acceptance and rumination) × 2 (time: t1 and t2) ANOVA with repeated measures on time for body satisfaction revealed no significant main effect of time, F(1, 28) = 1.149, ns, η2 = 0.039; no significant main effect of condition, F(1, 28) = 0.123, ns, η2 = 0.004; and no significant interaction of Condition × Time, F(1, 28) = 0.471, ns, η2 = 0.017 (see Figure 1a for M and SD). Thus, the experimentally induced body dissatisfaction did not recover over time regardless of ER strategy used. The 2 × 2 ANOVA for distress about body feelings revealed no significant main effect of time, F(1, 28) = 0.017, ns, η2 = 0.001; no significant main effect of condition, F(1, 28) = 0.003, ns, η2 < 0.001; and no significant interaction of Condition × Time, F(1, 28) < 0.001, ns, η2 < 0.001 (see Figure 1b for M and SD). Thus, the experimentally induced distress about body feelings did not recover over time regardless of ER strategy used. The 2 × 2 ANOVA for mood revealed no significant main effect of time, F(1, 28) = 0.785, ns, η2 = 0.027; no significant main effect of condition, F(1, 28) = 0.613, ns, η2 = 0.021; but a significant interaction of Condition × Time, F(1,28) = 4.883, p = 0.035, η2 = 0.148. Post-hoc paired t-tests conducted separately by condition revealed no significant change in mood from t1 to t2 in the acceptance condition, t = −0.889, df = 13, ns, d = −0.240, but revealed a significant mood deterioration in the rumination condition nan",1.0
"(1) higher levels of children’s psychopathology (externalizing problems and PTSD symptoms), parental childhood experiences of violence, and parental psychopathology (PTSD and depressive symptoms, psychosocial impairment, alcohol abuse [only for fathers]) would be associated with increased violence by the respective parent according to child- and parent-report nan  We received partial support for our first hypothesis that characteristics of children and the respective parent would be associated with parental violence: Higher levels of children’s externalizing problems were associated with higher levels of maternal violence as reported by both children and mothers. This is in line with previous findings that have demonstrated bidirectional associations between children’s externalizing problems and parents’ use of physical violence (MacKenzie et al., 2014; Sriskandarajah et al., 2015; Wang & Liu, 2018). The validity of this finding is strengthened by our multi-informant approach. Furthermore, higher levels of children’s PTSD symptoms were associated with higher levels of maternal and paternal violence, but only in the child-report. Though children’s PTSD symptoms have not been investigated as potential risk factors, our findings are not surprising considering that specific PTSD symptoms, such as irritability, anger and concentration problems, may elicit violent parenting behavior (Catani, 2018; Timshel et al., 2017).",1.0

"The first aim was to delineate possible age differences in DoG and DD across the life span. The reviewed literature indicates an inverse U-shaped function of DoG, with young and older people performing worse on DoG when compared with the middle-aged people, and a U-shaped form for DD. nan The younger and older participants showed a less self-controlled behavior than the middle-aged subjects (see Figure 1). The regression equation for the relationship between DD and age supports these predictions. It resulted in a U-shaped function with better performances for the middle-aged participants and weaker performances for the younger and older, as predicted. ",1.0
"We expected that suicide-related outcomes (FU) are negatively linked to physical activity (BL) (Hypothesis 1a)  nan As expected, physical activity and PMH were negatively related to suicide-related outcomes three years later (confirmation of Hypothesis 1a and Hypothesis 1b).",1.0
"ADHD we hypothesised that increased glutamate levels in these brain areas are related to the psychopathology of ADHD, especially impulsivity and hyperactivity. The ADHD group showed a significant increase in glutamate in the ACC compared to controls, no significant differences in metabolites were observed in the DLPFC. Overall, glutamate levels in the ACC were positively correlated with ADHD symptomatology, especially hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms. nan",1.0
"The aim of the present study was replicating these findings in an independent sample of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. nan First of all, we replicated previous findings of deficient social cognition with our current schizophrenia sample [4, 6, 58]. Regarding the number of correct responses, the patient group performed significantly inferior to the healthy control group in the fMRI task, investigating emotion recognition and affective ToM. Patients, however, showed no significant aberrations in self-reported empathy, in the RMET, as well as in the MSCEIT.",1.0
"We hypothesized that the interaction of suicide intent and elevated pain persistence would predict higher medical risk and lower probability of an intervention of a recent suicide attempt as well as worse physical condition after the suicide attempt. nan Those who chose a more lethal suicide method tolerated more pain in a pressure algometer task, even after controlling for age, gender, number of lifetime suicide attempts, and suicide intent. This finding underscores the importance of pain persistence and is in line with the original assumptions of the IPTS (Joiner, 2005). However, pain persistence was unrelated both to probability of an intervention and to physical condition after the suicide attempt.",1.0
