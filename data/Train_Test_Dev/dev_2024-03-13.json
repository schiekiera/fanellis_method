{"text":"The current study aimed on evaluating this intervention program in a prospective randomized controlled design, comparing a treatment group (TG) with a wait-list control group (WCG) three months after beginning. nan The primary result of this study is that a brief hypnotherapeutic and behavioral intervention (TG) was able to reduce the pain frequency, pain duration, and pain intensity significantly compared to a waiting list control group. The superiority of the TG could be ascertained for children's and parent's reports of the symptoms. Additionally, we could demonstrate that children receiving the treatment showed a significant stronger improvement of pain-related disability compared the children who were waiting on the treatment to start. Interestingly, the TG showed no superiority regarding HRQoL from children's or parent's perspective","label":1.0}

Importantly, SPT also reduced auditory neglect. Immediate transfer of SPT to daily life tasks was observed for the paragraph reading test although reading was not trained.
