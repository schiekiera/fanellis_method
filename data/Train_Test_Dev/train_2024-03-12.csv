" In accordance with previous findings (Gren-Landell et al., 2009; Knappe et al., 2011; Kodal et al., 2017; Sunderland et al., 2016), c performance-related situations, especially speaking in front of others, to be most often feared and avoided, and that avoidance will mostly occur after fear. Social anxiety was predominantly reported for test situations and when speaking or performing in front of others. Avoidance was most prevalent in the latter situations With regard to the onset, it seems that avoidance behavior often occurs within a short period of time after the onset of strong fear emphasizing the need for early prevention measures",1.0
"To support success of interventions, measurement tools in usage are expected to be valid and reliable. The following report aims to further support factor structure recently found in the readiness of end-of-life conversations (REOLC) scale [12] nan The REOLC Scale is the first German instrument to reliably measure cancer patients' readiness end-of-life conversations (REOLC). Factor structure and correlations with advance care engagement in addition to non-existent correlations with general anxiety, depression or distress screenings confirmed good psychometric properties.",1.0
"The second aim of the study was to investigate whether patients suffering from suicide ideation with or without PMH differ in terms of lifetime suicide attempts. Lifetime suicide attempts were more common in suicide ideators with low levels of PMH than in suicide ideators with moderate/high levels of PMH in the inpatient sample, (χ2 = 4.79, df = 1, p = 0.029), but not in the outpatient sample, (χ2 = 2.33, df = 1, p=0.127). The general result pattern remained stable, regardless of whether a higher (PMH<15 vs. PMH≥15) or a lower (PMH<13 vs. PMH≥13) PMH-cutoff was used. nan",1.0

"Finally, the present study addresses the following research questions: (1) Do adolescents, young adults, and older adults show significant differences in episodic memory and visual working memory performances due to their gender and age? nan Further on, a contrary gender-linked effect was found for visual episodic memory in terms of a men's advantage over women. Although this was proven to be true for adolescents and older adults, unexpectedly, young male adults and young female adults both performed at an equally high level.",1.0
"To cross-validate a psychometric scale, entitled S-Scale, that was created based on the items of Study 1 in a different population-based sample. nan Study 2 showed, in a large population-based sample, that the psychological mindset measured with the S-Scale differentiated between individuals with lower and higher objective SES. Internal consistency of the scale was good.",1.0
"We hypothesized that voluntary combatants perpetrated more violence and perceived violence intrinsically as more fascinating and appealing than forcibly recruited combatants. Hence, they would show higher levels of appetitive aggression. nan Results showed that voluntary combatants reported more perpetrated violence types and a higher level of appetitive aggression than combatants who were forcibly recruited",1.0
"Given the empirical evidence outlined above, we hypothesized that participants featuring both relatively strong inhibitory control and low hedonic response towards food will be most successful in reducing their body weight during the weight reduction programme. nan Results confirmed our hypothesis in that the interaction of food-related inhibitory control and hedonic response towards food would be a stronger predictor of weight reduction than the both factors alone.",1.0
"Therefore, we expected substantial differences between dyads in the amount of mimicry. nan Above all, our research showed that mimicry, like several other interpersonal behaviors (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991; Kenny et al., 2001), is mostly dyadic, highly reciprocal, and explained substantially by the unique relationship between interaction partners.",1.0
"We hypothesize that nightmare dreamers report more violence, negative emotions and threatening events in nightmares than the control group, indicating that they experience their dreams as more harmful and distressing. There were significantly more positive emotions and less negative emotions in non-nightmare dreams of the control group than in non-nightmare dreams of nightmare dreamers. As well, nightmare dreamers reported significantly more violent dream contents than the non-nightmare dreamers in the non-nightmare dreams. Thus, the first hypothesis is confirmed (Table 1) nan",1.0
"Given the mixed picture of previous results, we hypothesized a genotype-dependent differential effect on treatment response without specifying the direction of effect There were no differences between 5-HTTLPR genotypes in treatment outcome effects at the immediate posttreatment assessment. However, we observed a highly significant genotype × treatment effect (p = 0.004) at the 7-month follow-up. Fear levels of homozygous S allele carriers differed from those heterozygous (p = 0.026) and homozygous (p = 0.012) for the L allele. Compared to posttreatment assessment, LL allele carriers exhibited a further fear decrease at the follow-up assessment. In contrast, SS allele carriers displayed a strong return of fear. nan",1.0
"More specifically the following hypotheses were tested. At the beginning of the movement period of motor imagery: (1) Elite experts show stronger T4-Fz and weaker T3-Fz 4–7 Hz theta coherence compared to amateurs, which implies that experts rely more on visual–attentional motor than on verbal–analytical cortical processes. nan We found stronger cortico-cortical communication between right temporal and premotor cortex indexed by stronger 4–7 Hz theta coherence between T4 and Fz in experts compared to amateurs. Further, experts showed closely significant stronger theta coherence between T4 and Fz than between T3 and Fz. Amateurs in contrary showed significantly stronger T3-Fz than T4-Fz theta coherence.",1.0
"In light of the literature reviewed above, we hypothesised that negative emotions evoked by unpleasant stimuli would be more intense during intra- compared with inter-personal intrinsic ER, as indexed by higher subjective ratings and greater skin-conductance responses. Pairwise comparisons for the significant Condition-by-Arousal interaction (p < .001) revealed that, in response to low-arousal images, subjective emotional reactions were significantly less intense under the Intra- compared with the Inter-personal condition (p < .001) [...]  For nSCRs, a significant main effect of Condition (p = .001) revealed a significantly higher frequency of physiological responses under the Intra- compared with the Inter-personal condition, but there was no significant main effect of Strategy (p > .477). [..] In summary, both physiological responses supported our initial hypothesis by demonstrating decreased arousal following inter- compared with intra-personal ER. However, a contradictory pattern emerged for subjective responses. nan",1.0
"Hypothesis 1: Sessions in which patients or therapists per- ceive a rupture are followed by worse alliance and higher symptom impairment in the subsequent session than are ses- sions in which the patient or the therapist do not perceive a rupture, controlling for symptom and alliance ratings in the rupture session respectively nan Consistent with the theoretical literature and confirming our hypotheses, we found a within-patient effect of patient-reported ruptures on subsequent alliance and symptom levels: sessions in which patients experienced a rupture were followed by lower alliance ratings and higher symptoms at the subsequent session than were sessions in which patients did not experience a rupture.",1.0
"In this study, we tested whether interaction partners would evaluate community-dwelling participants with schizophrenia less favorably than healthy controls and whether this difference would be explained by reduced smiling behavior related to schizophrenia. IP indicated less willingness for future interactions with SZ than with HC participants (d = −0.72) but SZ and HC did not differ with respect to smiling or affect recognition. nan",1.0
"this secondary exploratory analysis examined whether (i) baseline scores of depressive symptoms moderated the effects of the preoperative psychological interventions on depressive symptoms in heart surgery patients 1 day before surgery, 4 to 6 days after surgery and 6 months after surgery, The baseline score of depressive symptoms (HADS) moderated the intervention effects on depressive symptoms. The significant group by time by baseline depressive symptoms-interaction implied this moderation (p = 0.040, Table 2). For all baseline scores of depressive symptoms significant group differences were reported in post-hoc simple slope analyses (see Fig. 2): Patients with high baseline scores of depressive symptoms (+ 1 SD) receiving SUPPORT or EXPECT showed significant lower scores of depressive symptoms 6 months after surgery compared to the control group (EXPECT vs. SMC: p = 0.015, SUPPORT vs. SMC: p = 0.004). 1 week after surgery patients receiving SUPPORT also showed significant lower scores of depressive symptoms compared to SMC (p = 0.009), while there were no significant differences for EXPECT vs. SMC (p = 0.246). No statistically significant differences were observed 1 day before surgery for high baseline scores of depressive symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention groups (p ≥ 0.077).  Baseline levels of depressive symptoms, personal control, and concern seemed to moderate the intervention effects on depressive symptoms, personal control, and concern. ",1.0
"The present study is a partially exploratory examination with the following four hypotheses and questions: We predicted that (a) CBT increases the use of adjusting and tolerating, and decreases the use of concealing; nan Although our results did not reveal a significant decrease in concealing, both of the other affective styles increased significantly according to our hypotheses.",1.0
"Thus, we investigated whether the anti-suicide function is a predictor for a wide spectrum of suicidal behaviors in female adolescents, considering suicidal ideation (intensity and duration) and suicide attempts. nan Our findings suggest that the anti-suicide function does not significantly predict occurrence of current suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts, but this might be explained by the small sample size reporting anti-suicide functions.",0.0
"The study’s primary aim was to test whether CBM-APP, compared to the control condition, could successfully reduce dysfunctional appraisals, operationalized via a scenario-based approach assessing idiosyncratic, trauma-relevant appraisals [44]  In intention-to-treat analyses, participants receiving CBM-APP showed a greater reduction in dysfunctional appraisals on a scenario task from pre- to posttraining (primary outcome) assessments, compared to those receiving sham training (d = 1.30, 95% CI 0.82–1.80), nan",1.0
"The research objective of the present investigation is to evaluate the pragmatic effectiveness of face-to-face CBT for family caregivers of PwD delivered in a routine care setting. nan The analyzes yielded significant effects of F2F-CBT on symptoms of depression, emotional well-being, and coping with the care situation at posttest, as well as on emotional well-being and QoL regarding social relationships at 6-month follow-up relative to CG.",1.0
"We hypothesized that, as compared to the control group, the intervention group will show a stronger pre- to post-assessment reduction of (a) body image-related negative interpretation bias nan Contrary to our hypothesis, participants who received six sessions of this intervention did not show stronger reductions in body image-related negative interpretation bias",0.0
"More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that successful emotion regulation skills application would negatively predict subsequent depressive symptoms in individuals suffering from at least some symptoms of depression over a 5-year period. nan In line with our hypothesis, we found that the general successful skills application negatively predicted subsequent depressive symptom severity over a 5-year period, even when controlling for initial symptom severity.",1.0

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a Web-based guided self-help intervention to prevent major depressive disorder (MDD) in people with subthreshold depression (sD). nan Offering the intervention has an acceptable likelihood of being more cost-effective than enhanced usual care and could therefore reach community members on a wider scale.,1.0
"It was hypothesized that participants in the video feedback group would continue to demonstrate significantly greater online awareness 8 to 10 weeks after the last intervention session of the RCT compared to the verbal and experiential feedback groups Participants in the video feedback group continued to demonstrate significantly greater gains in online awareness as compared to participants in the verbal feedback group (mean difference 20.6, 95% CI 8.8 to 32.3) and the experiential feedback group (mean difference 14.4, 95% CI 3.1 to 25.6) (Table 2). nan",1.0
"Accordingly, the present study tested the following two hypotheses: (1) the lack of positive expectations predicts depressive symptoms 8 weeks later more than the presence of negative expectations; nan The present study tested the hypothesis that in a nonclinical sample depressive symptoms are predicted by a lack of positive expectations, rather than by the presence of overly negative expectations. This hypothesis was not confirmed. In fact, given the very strong influence of baseline depressive symptoms on depressive symptoms at follow-up, neither positive nor negative expectations were associated with depressive symptoms in the longitudinal analysis, nor were dysfunctional attitudes and dispositional optimism.",0.0
"Further, we investigated whether children with AP-related FGIDs in community show higher rates of somatization and psychological distress. nan Rome III abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders are a common health problem in children and are, even in community, strongly associated with other somatic complaints and psychological distress",1.0
"First, we hypothesized that more pronounced externalizing and internalizing MHP in adolescence increase the likelihood of attaining a lower level of education in early adulthood. nan In line with previous findings, more pronounced externalizing MHP in adolescence predicted an increased likelihood of attaining a lower level of education in early adulthood.",1.0
"We hypothesized that optimizing patient expectations improves outcome in CABG patients, especially in terms of disability as the primary outcome, but also in terms of general quality of life, subjective fitness for work, physical activity levels, and emotional outcomes. Patients in the EXPECT group showed significantly larger improvements in disability (−12.6; −17.6 to −7.5) than the SMC group (−1.9; −6.6 to +2.7); patients in the SUPPORT group (−6.7; −11.8 to 1.7) did not differ from the SMC group. Comparing follow-up scores and controlling for baseline scores of EXPECT versus SUPPORT on the variable disability only revealed a trend in favor of the EXPECT group (P = 0.09). Specific advantages for EXPECT compared to SUPPORT were found for mental quality of life and fitness for work (hours per week). Both psychological pre-surgery interventions induced less pronounced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations reflected by decreased interleukin-8 levels post-surgery compared to changes in SMC patients and lower interleukin-6 levels in patients of the EXPECT group at follow-up.  nan",1.0
"We expected the EMA item set to capture moment-to-moment variability, reflected by mean squared successive differences (MSSDs), an indicator of variability. nan Measures of within-person variability (MSSD and ICC) indi- cated that all items were capable of capturing considerable amounts of within-person fluctuation.",1.0
"We expected that responses of individuals high and low in aE would follow an inverted U-shaped function and/or that individuals high and low in aE differ systematically in the time course or dominance of sulpiride's pre- and postsynaptic effects. nan The present study focused on paradoxical dopaminergic effects and confirmed that the effect of sulpiride on posterior vs. anterior theta activity strongly depends on aE. Low aE showed more frontally distributed theta than high aE, and under 200 and 400 mg sulpiride this difference was reversed: high aE showed a shift toward anterior theta, but low aE, a shift toward posterior theta. Furthermore, we found marked aE-related response differences across time. Thus, the present findings support the basic idea that besides general responses to pharmacological agents and static models like an inverted U-function, time aspects of pharmacological effects contain valuable information regarding the biological basis of Extraversion.",1.0
"Thus, we hypothesized MT-ALEX to significantly improve emotion recognition skills and to significantly reduce alexithymia when compared to a psychoeducation-only control condition. nan When compared to a psychoeducation-only control condition, our findings suggest that participating in the SBI group led to a significant improvement in computer-assessed emotion recognition skills. Moreover, results indicate significant improvements in self-reported alexithymia over the intervention period in favor of the intervention group.",1.0
"In line with the prediction of Attentional Control Theory that psychopathology would impair performance especially on tasks relying on the central executive, we expected that 1) psychopathology would mediate (indirect association a x f) the association between maltreatment and visuospatial working memory (direct association c). nan Higher levels of maltreatment by parents were indirectly related to lower short-term and working memory capacity through increased levels of internalizing problems, PTSD symptoms and maladaptive cognitions about themselves and the world.",1.0

"Here, we examined if C tactile perception is abnormal in a broader range of mental disorders and if such abnormality might provide a functional biomarker of mental disease. nan However, patients rated touch generally less pleasant than comparison subjects. This effect was especially pronounced in patients with disorders of personality. The attenuation of overall pleasantness of touch might be due to specific reductions of hedonic tone of tactile stimulation or rely on other influencing factors such as being less comfortable in interpersonal interactions in general. [..] These findings suggest that quantifying the degree of affective touch awareness might be a potential trans-diagnostic biomarker for autistic traits.",1.0
"Thus, we expected that both psychological interventions (in addition to surgery) would lead to better outcomes compared to SMC in patients with lower baseline inflammatory status. nan In contrast to our hypothesis that both preoperative psychological interventions would lead to better outcomes compared to SMC in low inflammatory status patients, we only found a trend for EXPECT to lead to higher mental quality of life in low baseline CRP patients compared to SMC only.",1.0
"We hypothesized that: (1) according to the dose-effect or building block effect (Anda et al., Citation2006; Mollica, Poole, & Tor, Citation1998; Neuner et al., Citation2004) traumatic event types correlated positively with PTSD symptom severity;  nan The results of this study revealed that the number of traumatic event types correlated positively with PTSD symptom severity. ",1.0
"1) is attention predictive of emotion knowledge over the course of one year? (“Attention Effect Hypothesis”); There were significant negative cross-lagged effects from inattention T1 to emotional competence T2 and from inattention T2 to emotional competence T3, indicating that individuals´ deviations from expected emotional competence scores were predicted by their inattention scores at the previous time point Our data supports neither the “Attention Effect Hypothesis” nor the “Emotion Knowledge Hypothesis”, but it does indicate the need for targeted interventions for those children identified as being either highly inattentive or having inadequate emotional competences",1.0
"Based on the existing literature on both structural and functional changes in GAD, higher GM volumes in the amygdala and putamen and lower GM volumes in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral PFC, hippocampus and ventral ACC were expected for GAD compared with healthy controls. nan The following main results were obtained, as hypothesized, for the GAD group: (1) Higher GM volumes were found in the basal ganglia and in particular in a cluster in the right striatum including the putamen and caudate nucleus. (2) Lower WM volumes were found in the dorsolateral PFC. (3) For these key regions, the dimensional approach revealed largely comparable alterations.",1.0
"We expected to observe a negative association between exposure to teacher violence and children’s social status. nan First, our results primarily showed that teacher violence was not related to children’s social centrality status and only inconsistently to children’s social preference status. This means that, contrary to our hypothesis, experiencing more violence at school was only partly associated with lower levels of social status if no other variables were considered.",1.0
"It is hypothesized that participants will rate the usability of the intervention elements across all measures as above average. nan A dependent samples t-Test on a conservatively chosen cutoff of 5 as indication of adequate usability revealed a statistically significant difference from this cutoff (t(31) = 10.12, p < .001), thus, providing evidence for the first hypothesis (Figure 1).",1.0

"In this study, we specifically searched for memory-associated DNA sequence variants predicted to affect miRNA-to-mRNA binding using a similar strategy as described previously by our group (Lill et al., 2014) Our analyses uncovered three memory-associated SNPs which potentially manifest their molecular effects by interfering with miRNA function. Intriguingly, two of these SNPs, by independent mechanisms, affect hsa-mir-138-1, a miRNA long known to be crucial in CNS development and function in mammals (Miska et al., 2004; Siegel et al., 2009) but hitherto not specifically linked to cognitive performance in humans.

"In detail, we hypothesized that PSY would show more stress at rest (i.e., maladaptivity). This would be evident in increased heart rate, decreased HRV, and increased negative affect compared to HC and CHR. ANCOVAs controlling for age revealed significant group differences for both investigated vagal HRV parameters, which were reduced in PSY compared to HC.

"Based on the literature, we hypothesize overall high concordance in symptom occurrence between parental and offspring DSM-IV symptoms [16]. That is, the occurrence of a specific parental symptom of DSM-IV anxiety disorders increases the risk for the occurrence of the same symptom in these parents’ offspring. nan Moreover, specific parental DSM-IV symptoms predicted the same DSM-IV symptoms in offspring, confirming high disorder specific concordance as reported previously.",1.0
"The purpose of the present study was to assess the psychometric properties of the German adaption of the QBPDS and to provide further data concerning the factor structure. The QBPDS showed strong psychometric properties, with high internal consistency for the full scale (α=0.94) and good convergent and divergent validity. The factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution (bending, ambulation, brief effortful movements, and long-lasting postures). In summary, this psychometric study supports the use of the German version of the QBPDS as a reliable and valid self-report instrument for the assessment of functional disability. Furthermore, the results indicated four underlying dimensions, including two of the original factors (“bending” and “ambulation”) and two new subscales, which we labeled “brief effortful movements” and “long-lasting postures”",1.0

"We, therefore, predicted that women using expressive suppression less habitually should make more errors and subsequent errors than men, whereas women with relatively frequent use of habitual expression should perform comparably. nan In conclusion, gender differences in mental rotation performance and feedback processing were qualified by emotion regulation strategies: Inferior performance of women in the mental rotation task and impaired feedback processing was particularly observed in women not habitually using expressive suppression. High habitual use of expressive suppression in the group of women resulted in performance relatively comparable with men.",1.0
"In summary, the present study, for the first time, tested the hypothesis of the Component Process Model that the processing of the goal conduciveness check precedes the processing of the power check in time.  In other words, the motivational valence of the feedback stimuli is hypothesized to be processed first and the integration of other feedback stimuli characteristics, such as the degree of power to decide about outcome and monetary magnitude, to be processed consecutively. nan These temporal differential appraisal check effects suggest sequential processing of the goal conduciveness and the power check, which is the first empirical evidence for this specific notion and gives further support to the sequence hypothesis of the processing of appraisal checks of the Component Process Model, an assumption that is not made by other appraisal theories of emotion.

"(2) Do children with frequent AP differ in their ANS/HPA axis reaction from children with anxiety disorders?  nan There were no significant group differences at baseline. Successful task performance, however, produced a co-activation of sympathetic (low-frequency) and parasympathetic (HF) activity in children with AP which may suggest an increased vigilance. […] With respect to HPA axis activation, conceptualized by measuring saliva cortisol concentration, we found that basal cortisol secretion (AUCB) differed between the three groups on a trend level. Since the overall threefold comparison is a conservative criterion (including a small group with n = 12), the results attaining strong effect sizes are encouraging.

The post-CBT network showed the highest connectivity: the sum of all edges was 14.0 compared with before CBT (10.3, p = 0.007) and with after 12 sessions of CBT (9.7, p = 0.011). The connectivity of the pre-CBT network and the network after 12 sessions of CBT did not differ significantly (p = 0.227). nan",1.0
"The aim of this project was to explore if general perinatal markers can distinguish adolescent patients with a SUD from adolescent patients with other psychiatric disorders. The binary logistic regression model predicting group membership (SUD vs. GEN) from GA, weight, APGAR5 and birth mode was not statistically significant (X2 [4] = 4.77, p = .312, Cox & Snell R² = 0.053). Neither did any single predictor reach statistical significance, see Table 3. Interpreting odds ratios indicates an effect of birth mode, with participants born through C-section being 2.46 times more likely to belong to the GEN group. nan",0.0
"We hypothesized MT-PRO to reduce procrastination in an academic context and expected effects to be stable at one month follow-up These analyses resulted in a significant effect for the interaction of time and group on the sum score of the APROF (F(1.5,34.8) = 4.11; η2 = .15, 95%-CI = .00–.35). T-tests showed that participants in the intervention group reported a significantly greater reduction of procrastination from pre- to post-treatment (t(13) = 3.95; d = 0.75, 95%-CI = 0.41–1.15; than participants in the control group (t(12) = − 0.53; d = − 0.14, 95%-CI = − 0.40–0.16). [..] Follow-up analyses on general procrastination symptoms indicated that the superiority of the intervention over the control group was sustained at the end of the 4-week follow-up assessment. nan",1.0
"The primary goal was to investigate differences in frequency of substance use between subgroups of adolescent SUD patients (with a history of TEs and PTSD, with TEs but without PTSD, with no trauma exposure) and to explore the relationships between substance use frequency and the three PTSD SCs (intrusion, hyperarousal, avoidance). nan The proportion of participants who had used MDMA in the last month differed between groups (X2 (2) = 10.60, p = .005, αBonferroni-Holm = .010, d = .62) with the probable PTSD group reporting the highest proportion of past-month MDMA users. No difference in the use of other substances could be identified.",1.0
"The study tested whether the vMMN was observable when the visual input is restricted to one visual hemifield and, with this, only para-foveal input to one of the two primary sensory cortices in the visual system is available for stimulus processing.  The vMMN was elicited by the stimulation restricted to a small portion of the visual field. The present ERP results demonstrate vMMN generation when stimulus presentation is restricted to one visual hemifield.",1.0
"Based on the CVTAE (see illustration in Figure 1), we hypothesised that both self-efficacy and achievement emotions played multiple mediational roles in the studied relationship (Pekrun, Citation2006). nan As shown in Figure 2, the presence of direct paths from cognitive activation to some CMC learning strategies in addition to indirect paths through self-efficacy and/or boredom or enjoyment confirms partial mediation effects. Further, as shown in Figure 3, the absence of a direct path from cognitive activation to metacognition confirms full multiple mediation effects.",1.0
"We expect children in the intervention group to show a reduction in psychopathology and to be more knowledgeable after the Family Talk Intervention group program.  nan As expected, children in the Family Talk Intervention group demonstrated significantly more knowledge about parental mental illness, emotions, and support possibilities after the intervention compared to children in the other two groups […] Healthy control children and children in the Family Talk Intervention group showed a significant reduction in externalizing symptoms compared to children in the Wait Control group.",1.0
"We hypothesized that the majority of individuals would show typical inverted U-shaped curves, with a significant negative quadratic fit; however, there would be a number of individuals where this is not present, due to variation in the population and the perception of pleasantness. nan Only 42% of the participants had a pleasantness rating pattern that significantly fit an inverted U-shaped curve and a similar number showed a linear rating pattern, although note that both quadratic and linear fits could be significant in the same participant.",0.0
"The objective of this study was to translate the PROMIS Depression item bank into German and evaluate the psychometric properties of the translated items. nan Overall, the translated version of the PROMIS Depression item bank showed good psychometric properties, none of the items had to be removed because of its distribution characteristics.",1.0
"Therefore, we hypothesize that the DES sum score correlates with the symptom severity of depression indicating concurrent validity. nan The DES sum score strongly correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms.",1.0
"We hypothesized that participants with previous experience of childhood maltreatment would show lower hippocampal volumes than participants without experience of childhood maltreatment Results: Our analysis revealed significantly lower left hippocampal volume in people with maltreatment (left F1,432 = 5.686, p = 0.018; right F1,433 = 3.371, p = 0.07), nan",1.0
"One of our main goals was to explore the differential impact of congruent versus incongruent teacher-student fit-constellations on the students’ use of SRML-strategies and to identify its differentiation to students’ satisfaction and interest in PE. [...] We hypothesize in accordance to our own findings (Lindberg et al., submitted) that perceived teacher-student congruence is important for students’ satisfaction and interest. For all LSS-PE dimensions, the mean scores of students’ satisfaction and interest in PE were highest in the group with a congruent fit-constellation. nan",1.0
"We hypothesized that at the end of the 6-month intervention (main study endpoint), participants of the Tele.TAnDem intervention would report fewer symptoms of depression and physical symptoms and a lower burden of care, as well as higher well-being than the control group. nan Intention-to-treat analyses showed improved emotional well-being (γ = 9.59, p = .001), fewer symptoms of depression (γ = −0.23, p = .043), fewer physical health symptoms (γ = −0.25, p = .019), improved coping with the care situation (γ = 0.25, p = .005) and the behavior of the care recipient (γ = 0.23, p = .034) compared with usual care.",1.0
"In the present study, we expected HRV to be negatively related to SI in a sample of young participants without current mental disorders and without suicide attempt history. A significant correlation between the ln10-transformed high-frequency band of resting vagally mediated HRV and SI was found (r=−.33, p<.05). nan",1.0
"In this study, it was hypothesised that i) both brief videos to optimise expectations would augment the effectiveness of a single PMR session compared to a control group nan While we were able to confirm that brief videos using placebo mechanism can increase a psychological intervention's efficacy for a subgroup of participants, contrary to our expectations, the video aiming to optimise outcome expectations of the PMR session with a competent but less warm expert elicited a nocebo effect regarding less perceived stress reduction than both other groups.",1.0
"To sum up, in the current study we tested the following hypotheses: (1) Cognitive interference is generally increased in BED, as indicated by interference effects across stimuli of all categories. Following this rationale, results from the n-back task with lures suggest that the BED group generally suffers more strongly from cognitive interference, as indicated by comparable effects in both eating related and neutral stimuli. In contrast, findings from the recent-probes task support the notion of a more specific eating-related memory bias in BED, as indicated by a selective effect in eating-related stimuli in this group. nan",1.0
"(1) All groups experience comparable interference at response selection as long as the presented stimuli are neutral. nan Confirming hypothesis (1), all groups revealed comparable response interference in case of neutral color primes",1.0
a) Do highly psychopathic offenders exhibit impaired attention to the eyes in naturalistic settings?

"The aim of this study is to detect grey matter volume (GMV) reductions in distinct regions of the brain which are associated (1) with positive and/or negative symptoms [...] To verify the a priori hypothesized assumption of two distinct pathomechanisms for positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia, we compared subjects with high versus low positive and negative symptoms respectively according to the PANSS positive and negative subscales. [...] nan The present study links GMV reductions in schizophrenia patients with WM impairments on the one hand and positive as well as negative symptoms on the other hand. Most interestingly, the results underscore the notion of two distinct pathophysiological mechanisms both independently contributing to the well established WM impairment in schizophrenia:",1.0
"Thus, the aim of the present study was to further clarify the effectiveness of psychological interventions for sD by evaluating the effectiveness of a newly developed web-based guided self-help intervention in a large-scale randomised controlled trial. The results indicated a greater reduction in depressive symptom severity in the intervention group compared to the control group at post-treatment. Effects were sustained at 6-month follow-up. nan",1.0
"It was expected that both the FtF intervention and the chat-based intervention would equally improve primary sleep outcomes compared to WL as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) nan In overall sleep quality as the main outcome variable, both intervention groups improved compared to the waiting list control group (dFtF = 1.02; dChat = 1.69), and compared to the pre-test, changes remained until FU (dFtF = 1.18; dchat = 2.40).",1.0
"3) is there a correlation between cohesion and the satisfaction with g-PP? Is there a correlation between cohesion and the satisfaction with group-based personal practice? As Table 3 indicates, all cohesion subscales were significantly associated with a positive impact on personal or professional development, whereby Positive Bonding achieved the highest correlations (r≥.35, p<.001. nan",1.0
