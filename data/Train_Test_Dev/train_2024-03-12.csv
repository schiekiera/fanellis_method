"Hypothesis 1a We assume that the degree of positive social support within the support social network is significantly higher compared to the CSN. We also assume that the degree of social negativity within the CSN is significantly higher compared to the support social network. H1a: Referring to hypothesis 1a, participants received more positive social support from members in the SSN compared to the CSN [t(37) = 6.00; p < 0.001, d = 0.97] and more social negativity from the members in the CSN compared to the SSN, [t(37) = –4.87; p < 0.001, d = 0.79 (Table 1)]. As predicted (hypothesis 1a), the SSN is characterized by a higher degree of positive social support and the CSN by a higher degree of social negativity. ",1.0

"this secondary exploratory analysis examined whether (i) baseline scores of depressive symptoms moderated the effects of the preoperative psychological interventions on depressive symptoms in heart surgery patients 1 day before surgery, 4 to 6 days after surgery and 6 months after surgery, The baseline score of depressive symptoms (HADS) moderated the intervention effects on depressive symptoms. The significant group by time by baseline depressive symptoms-interaction implied this moderation (p = 0.040, Table 2). For all baseline scores of depressive symptoms significant group differences were reported in post-hoc simple slope analyses (see Fig. 2): Patients with high baseline scores of depressive symptoms (+ 1 SD) receiving SUPPORT or EXPECT showed significant lower scores of depressive symptoms 6 months after surgery compared to the control group (EXPECT vs. SMC: p = 0.015, SUPPORT vs. SMC: p = 0.004). 1 week after surgery patients receiving SUPPORT also showed significant lower scores of depressive symptoms compared to SMC (p = 0.009), while there were no significant differences for EXPECT vs. SMC (p = 0.246). No statistically significant differences were observed 1 day before surgery for high baseline scores of depressive symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention groups (p ≥ 0.077).  Baseline levels of depressive symptoms, personal control, and concern seemed to moderate the intervention effects on depressive symptoms, personal control, and concern. ",1.0
"n this fMRI study we aimed at identifying areas which are specifically activated in relation to channelling of attention towards specific perceptual cues during movement execution in the hypnotic trance. We hypothesized that brain areas should become activated which are part of the so-called “human mirror-neuron-system”. Spearman rank correlations revealed that during hypnosis the left inferior frontal gyrus was correlated between motor imagery and movement (r = 0.72).  In addition, in our results the correlations of the inferior frontal gyrus and the premotor cortex reflect engagement of the human mirror neuron system ",1.0

"We aimed at replicating this relationship and tested whether objective and subjective levels of activity were associated with mood and whether the degrees of this association differ between depressed patients and never depressed controls (see Mata et al., 2012). We found significant associations between objective and subjective measures of activity in non-depressed as well as in MDD patients. We could replicate the finding, that objective measures of activity and mood are associated (Hollands et al., 2020; Reichert et al., 2016; Reichert, et al., 2017). […] In contrast to the activity/mood association in objective measures we did not observe significant associations between subjective ratings of activity and mood.",1.0

" In accordance with previous findings (Gren-Landell et al., 2009; Knappe et al., 2011; Kodal et al., 2017; Sunderland et al., 2016), c performance-related situations, especially speaking in front of others, to be most often feared and avoided, and that avoidance will mostly occur after fear. Social anxiety was predominantly reported for test situations and when speaking or performing in front of others. Avoidance was most prevalent in the latter situations With regard to the onset, it seems that avoidance behavior often occurs within a short period of time after the onset of strong fear emphasizing the need for early prevention measures",1.0

"If the inclinations to be more generous towards close others and potential reciprocators were early developing cultural universals, we would expect the same behavioral pattern of strong selectivity in early sharing also in Ugandan preschool children. Here, we show that preschool and elementary school aged Ugandan children show high levels of generosity independent of the social relationships with the recipient.  This finding points to societal differences in early sharing. ",1.0

"1) is attention predictive of emotion knowledge over the course of one year? (“Attention Effect Hypothesis”); There were significant negative cross-lagged effects from inattention T1 to emotional competence T2 and from inattention T2 to emotional competence T3, indicating that individuals´ deviations from expected emotional competence scores were predicted by their inattention scores at the previous time point Our data supports neither the “Attention Effect Hypothesis” nor the “Emotion Knowledge Hypothesis”, but it does indicate the need for targeted interventions for those children identified as being either highly inattentive or having inadequate emotional competences",1.0

"We hypothesized that treatments conducted under BITE supervision would exhibit stronger therapeutic alliances than those conducted under DVB supervision (Hypothesis 1). Thus, we found stronger therapeutic alliance (Hypothesis 1) and a higher level of competence (Hypothesis 2) in the BITE condition than in the DVB condition for the ITT analyses. We found that the treatments conducted under BITE supervision were associated with stronger therapeutic alliance compared with those conducted under DVB supervision (Hypothesis 1).",1.0

" To address the question whether the proclivities to empathize and mentalize are related on a behavioral and neural level, we first calculated correlations of inter-individual differences in empathy and ToM measures and secondly tested whether people with high empathic responding are distributed equally across people with high and low mentalizing capacities, and vice versa Using different convergent methods and analyses, we observed neither significant relationships between empathy- and ToM-related behavioral measures (within the EmpaToM and when including independent empathy and ToM tasks) nor between the respective underlying neural networks This finding suggests that the tendency to empathize does not contribute to and is not dependent on the capacity to infer others’ mental states. ",0.0

"The study tested whether the vMMN was observable when the visual input is restricted to one visual hemifield and, with this, only para-foveal input to one of the two primary sensory cortices in the visual system is available for stimulus processing.  The vMMN was elicited by the stimulation restricted to a small portion of the visual field. The present ERP results demonstrate vMMN generation when stimulus presentation is restricted to one visual hemifield.",1.0

"The aim of this study was to test whether performance and electrophysiological parameters in the time course from preparation to response execution or response control show familiality and may thus reflect potential endophenotypes for ADHD.  The latency detected at Pz was prolonged in the Flanker-CPT [marginal means 534 (S.D. = 122) ms v. 558 (S.D. = 118) ms, Task: F 1,164 = 8.3, p < 0.01, η2p = 0.05), but similar in the three groups (Group: F 2,164 = 0.2, p > 0.50, η2p <0.01, and Task × Group: F 2,164 = 1.5, p = 0.22, η2p = 0.02). [...]  Moreover, the Cue-P3 showed familiality effects (Group: F 2,164 = 4.0, p = 0.02, η2p = 0.05), with significantly larger amplitudes in controls than in ADHD, and as a tendency (p = 0.08) the intermediate values of the non-affected siblings also differed from both groups. Neural ADHD markers of covert preparation following cues, and partly markers of response inhibition in NoGo trials were familially driven in ADHD",1.0

"The purpose of the present study was to assess the psychometric properties of the German adaption of the QBPDS and to provide further data concerning the factor structure. The QBPDS showed strong psychometric properties, with high internal consistency for the full scale (α=0.94) and good convergent and divergent validity. The factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution (bending, ambulation, brief effortful movements, and long-lasting postures). In summary, this psychometric study supports the use of the German version of the QBPDS as a reliable and valid self-report instrument for the assessment of functional disability. Furthermore, the results indicated four underlying dimensions, including two of the original factors (“bending” and “ambulation”) and two new subscales, which we labeled “brief effortful movements” and “long-lasting postures”",1.0
