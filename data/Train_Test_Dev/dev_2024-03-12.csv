"In this study, we specifically searched for memory-associated DNA sequence variants predicted to affect miRNA-to-mRNA binding using a similar strategy as described previously by our group (Lill et al., 2014) Our analyses uncovered three memory-associated SNPs which potentially manifest their molecular effects by interfering with miRNA function. Intriguingly, two of these SNPs, by independent mechanisms, affect hsa-mir-138-1, a miRNA long known to be crucial in CNS development and function in mammals (Miska et al., 2004; Siegel et al., 2009) but hitherto not specifically linked to cognitive performance in humans. In summary, by combining unbiased genome-wide screening with extensive in silico modeling, in vitro functional assays, and gene expression profiling, our study identified miRNA-138 as a potential molecular regulator of human memory function.",1.0

"We hypothesized that providing smokers under inpatient psychiatric treatment with a training variant of the nicotine-AAT as compared to sham-control training would diminish an initial nicotine-related approach bias and reduce daily nicotine consumption.  Prior to the trainings, smokers in both conditions exhibited a stronger approach bias for nicotine-related pictures than for tooth-cleaning pictures. After both trainings, this difference was no longer evident. Although reduced smoking behavior at posttest was observed after both trainings, only the AAT-training led to a larger reduction of nicotine consumption at a three-month follow-up. Our preliminary data partially support the conclusion that the AAT might be a feasible tool to reduce smoking in the long-term in psychiatric patients, albeit its effect on other smoking-related measures remains to be explored.",1.0
