"The current study aimed on evaluating this intervention program in a prospective randomized controlled design, comparing a treatment group (TG) with a wait-list control group (WCG) three months after beginning. nan The primary result of this study is that a brief hypnotherapeutic and behavioral intervention (TG) was able to reduce the pain frequency, pain duration, and pain intensity significantly compared to a waiting list control group. The superiority of the TG could be ascertained for children's and parent's reports of the symptoms. Additionally, we could demonstrate that children receiving the treatment showed a significant stronger improvement of pain-related disability compared the children who were waiting on the treatment to start. Interestingly, the TG showed no superiority regarding HRQoL from children's or parent's perspective",1.0
"We expected (Hypothesis 1) that the patients’ mimicry would be lower than that of the therapists, as evidence on mood and mimicry in healthy populations suggests lower mimicry levels (Duffy & Chartrand, Citation2015; Likowski et al., Citation2011; van Baaren et al., Citation2006; Vrijsen et al., Citation2010). nan In line with research on mood and mimicry (van Baaren et al., Citation2006) and mimicry of patients with former depression (Geerts et al., Citation2006), the results show that patients generally displayed lower mimicry levels than therapists (Hypothesis 1), with women generally showing more mimicry than men do.",1.0
"If the inclinations to be more generous towards close others and potential reciprocators were early developing cultural universals, we would expect the same behavioral pattern of strong selectivity in early sharing also in Ugandan preschool children. Here, we show that preschool and elementary school aged Ugandan children show high levels of generosity independent of the social relationships with the recipient.  This finding points to societal differences in early sharing. ",1.0
"More concretely, we hypothesized a stronger regional identity—as evidenced by higher commitment, higher in-depth exploration, and lower reconsideration—to be associated with lower distances between personal relationships (between-person processes). nan Our results indicated that between-person and within-person processes show similar patterns with respect to most regional identity dimensions, thus strengthening their validity. Betweenperson means that young adults who reported a more established regional identity than others also had less distant relationships than those others, while within-person requires that changes over time within one young adult’s regional identity are associated with changes in the distance of that same young adult’s personal relationships",1.0

The underlying hypothesis for this objective was that most patients who report preoperative anxiety (no vs. yes) experience a negative emotional impact and would welcome support in coping with their anxiety. nan These findings confirm our primary hypothesis.,1.0
"The primary outcome of this study was successful sexual intercourse. We hypothesized that women assigned to the intervention group (IG) would be more likely to achieve penile penetration from pre-test to post-test than those in the WCG. nan In the present study, the differences between the IG and WCG in successful intercourse penetration were not statistically significant because women in the WCG also improved in their ability to have sexual intercourse.",0.0
"We hypothesized that shape differences in terms of an inward deformation detectable in the CA1 region are closely associated to symptom severity. For positive symptoms, the total subscale of the PANSS positive scale as well as the single items ‘delusions’ and ‘hallucinations’ were found to differentially correlate with the posterior CA1 subfield. Specifically, the hippocampal surface deformity in a region that consists of the CA1 subfield was negatively associated with the severity of positive symptoms (Table 3, scatter plot in Fig. 5). By controlling for the amount of daily antipsychotic treatment (partial correlation), that correlation remained significant (r = −0.386, P = 0.035). No significant association was found with the total score of the PANSS negative symptom scale and CA1 deformity. nan",1.0
"In line with the empathy-altruism hypothesis, we expected the willingness to engage in prosocial behavior towards the narrator following emotional videos (empathy induction) to be higher than after neutral videos and to increase with participants’ experienced negative affect. nan We replicate findings that an empathy induction leads to more prosocial decisions.",1.0
"A second goal of our study was to determine whether impaired mental state decoding and mental state reasoning might be associated with executive dysfunction.  The social cognition measures (IRI subscores, RMET score, faux pas detection/understanding/empathy scores) were correlated with the executive performance (inflexibility costs, working memory score) nan",1.0
"We expected that DCS, compared to placebo, would facilitate emotional learning during the CBM-App training task. Specifically, we expected that participants who received DCS, compared to those who received placebo, would show less dysfunctional appraisals pre-post CBM-App training and at follow-up (assessed via the Encoding Recognition Task (ERT) and the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI)). nan Contrary to our expectations, there was no greater decrease in dysfunctional appraisals in the DCS group compared to the placebo group.",0.0
"In the present RCT, we attempted to clarify 2 issues: (a) Does repetitive SPT of 5 treatment sessions reduce visual and auditory neglect to a significantly greater extent than 5 sessions of standard visual scanning therapy (VST)? nan This first RCT of pure SPT showed widespread therapeutic effects on visual neglect, which generalized across perceptual and visuomotor tasks. Importantly, SPT also reduced auditory neglect. Immediate transfer of SPT to daily life tasks was observed for the paragraph reading test although reading was not trained. Interestingly, the improvements were strongest (Figure 3C and D) in the dual cancellation task, which may indicate improved attentional resources after SPT. In terms of efficacy, SPT was clearly more effective within this short treatment duration (5 hours) than conventional VST.",1.0
"For an overview of the main goals and measures applied in each experiment see Fig. 1. In Experiment 1a and b, we validated the EmpaToM with existing behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigms of empathy/compassion and ToM, including the Socio-affective Video Task (Klimecki et al., 2013), a False Belief Task (Dodell-Feder et al., 2011), and the Imposing Memory Task (Kinderman et al., 1998). nan Experiments 1a and b demonstrate the validity of the empathy and ToM measures of the newly developed task on a behavioral and neural level.",1.0
"Based on Carstensen's socioemotional selectivity theory, we predict that emotionally meaningful teams are prioritized when occupational future time perspective (OFTP) is perceived as limited In the baseline condition, results showed the expected mediation effect of workers' OFTP on the relation between workers' age and preference for a familiar over a new team. nan",1.0
" Therefore, we hypothesized a stronger focus on intervention-related topics in CBT supervisions and a stronger focus on the relationship between the patient and therapist in PT supervisions (hypothesis 1).  To address the first hypothesis, we compared the frequency of supervisory topics in CBT and PT. In the MANOVA, significant differences between CBT and PT approaches were found for supervisory topics (V = 0.40; F (1,773) = 31.30; p < .001). For the different topics, most effect sizes for between-group differences were of small or moderate magnitude (see Table 2). Only for ‘therapeutic alliance’ (item 1; g = –0.88) and ‘patient homework’ (item 8; g = 1.24) were large effect sizes found. The ‘therapeutic alliance’ was discussed more frequently in PT-oriented than in CBT-oriented supervisions, and ‘patient homework’ was discussed more frequently in CBT-oriented than in PT-oriented supervisions. nan",1.0
"The following hypotheses guided the current study: First, children’s experiences of teacher and peer violence in school are directly associated with poorer school-related functioning as indicated by (a) lower academic performance and (b) higher school absenteeism. No significant direct associations were observed between children’s experiences of different types of violence and academic performance as well as school absenteeism nan",0.0
"In particular, in hypothesis (Ia) we expected zero to mild correlations between the three facets and higher correlations between Accuracy and Sensibility than between Accuracy and Awareness. nan In partial support of this hypothesis, we observed moderate correlations between Accuracy and Sensibility (r = 0.386), as well as Accuracy and Awareness (r = 0.577) when evaluating indices of the heartbeat discrimination task.",1.0
"The aim of this longitudinal study is to look for possible gender differences that might emerge in the formation of the math-related self-concept For the math self-concept, significant main effects for measuring time, F(1, 79) = 11.23, p < 1.001, η2 = .12 and gender, F(1, 79) = 7.14, p < .01, η2 = .08 were found, whereas the interaction measuring time x gender was not significant. The main effect for measuring time indicated that the math self-concept for all children declined from first to second grade. The significant main effect for gender revealed a difference between girls and boys regarding their math self-concept. According to the bonferroni post hoc simple effects, differences between girls and boys were not significant in the first but in the second grade (see Table 1). Furthermore, whereas the math self-concept of the boys declined only marginally (p = .09), the decline was significant for the girls (p < .05) nan",1.0
" We hypothesized that mothers would use CT optimal velocities to stroke their children. Our observation that mothers utilize CT optimal stroking velocities, is consistent with findings in mothers and their term born children [65,48].  nan",1.0
" In line with the literature, we hypothesized that female gender, younger age, a longer time span untreated, the experience of sexual abuse and the experience of multiple traumatic events were associated with poor outcome. nan Female gender, victims of multiple traumatic events and victims of sexual violence as well as the cases with a higher number of intervention sessions were at risk for poor treatment outcome. The other sociodemographic, trauma-or intervention-related predictors were not significantly related with the outcome (results not shown).",1.0
"Here, we assessed whether restraint and uncontrolled eating as markers of trait-like variability in eating are associated with higher intra-individual variability in reward seeking as captured by a cost-benefit paradigm. To test this hypothesis, As predicted, we found that greater trial-by-trial effort variability was associated with lower scores on cognitive restraint, rp(78) = -0.28, p = .011 (controlled for average effort). In line with previous findings, higher wanting variability was associated with higher BMI, rp(78) = 0.25, p = .026 (controlled for average effort). nan",1.0
" In line with current models on the onset and maintenance of AN (Haynos and Fruzzetti, 2011), we predicted that an induction of sadness would lead to an increase of DTR and DTE only in individuals with AN. . Main results reveal that DTR significantly increased after the film clip in women with AN only, while DTE decreased over time in all groups nan",1.0
"We hypothesized that (1b) those nurses with high resilience report less symptom burden than those with low resilience (O’Dowd et al., 2018). nan In line with hypothesis (1b) and thereby complementing findings of O’Dowd et al. (2018), nurses with high resilience reported less psychological burden than those with low to medium resilience.",1.0
" Is CBASP equally or even more effective in treating depression than traditional CBT focusing on cognitive restructuring and behavioral techniques?   Our primary outcome Beck Depression Inventory-II indicated a general advantage of the CBT arms compared to CBASP [F(6, 154.5) = 4.2, p = 0.001], with significant contrasts in particular in favor of CBT-E. Effect sizes against WL were d = 0.91 (CBT-E), 0.87 (CBT-M), and 0.47 (CBASP). A triple interaction with an additional factor “chronic versus episodic depression” [F(6, 142.7) = 2.2, p = 0.048] indicated that the treatments resulted in different outcomes, with best results again for CBT-E in particular in episodic depression.  nan",0.0
"The goal of the current study was thus to establish whether the CAARS could discriminate between different patient groups presenting with symptoms similar to and/or frequently/accompanying adult ADHD, specifically disorders associated with emotion dysregulation and the lack of behavioral inhibition like obesity and problematic gambling. nan Our results demonstrate that with machine learning analyses, the various groups of patients we assumed to be similar in terms of impulse control and emotion regulation4,9,10 were very well distinguishable from each other as well as from the control group.",1.0
Alliance ratings will increase significantly during the course of treatment. nan Our first hypothesis was confirmed with a significant increase of alliance ratings over the 24 sessions of treatment.,1.0
